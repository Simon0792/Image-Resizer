1-How to install and setup
Download all files to your computer, you will need to also download a few dependancies.
A file called requirements.txt lists them but for the sake of simplicity i am going to list them here as well.
The dependencies you need are:

#Pillow
#pyinstaller (optional)

Optionally,once you have finished the previous step, you can create an executable version (.exe) using py installer. Installing the dependencies and creating the executable file requires PIP installed. If you do not have PIP installed or if you have trouble creating the executable, this is a great tutorial that helped me along the way:

2-How to use
Run the main program and chose option 1. You will be required to provide the link to the image folder that you want to resize. If you are using a command prompt or terminal you can also drag and drop the image folder into the terminal when required. you will be required to insert the image folder twice, once when resizing images in the 1600px ratio and once for the 1000px size.
In your image folder, two subfolders will be created. One folder will be called 1600px and the other 1000px and they will contain the images in those sizes.
if you want to resize more images, make sure that your image folder DOES NOT CONTAIN folders called 1600px or 1000px otherwise you will get errors.

This is version 1.0 of the program, if you run into problems or would like to ask me questions please contact me at
